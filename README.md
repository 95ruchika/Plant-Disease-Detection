# Plant-Disease-Detection
●	Built a three-step detection model which consists of (Crop classification, Disease classification, and Disease detection).
●	The dataset used is Plant Village Dataset which was taken from Kaggle..
● The crops used are Tomato,Potato,and Bell Pepper.
●	5 pre-trained CNN Algorithms were used (AlexNet, Resnet50, VGG19, GoogleNet,and EfficientNetB0).
● The dataset was divided into 80:20 ratio, 80%-training dataset and 20%-test dataset.
●	It involved Data Augmentation, Data Preprocessing, and Classification Techniques that helped to increase the model performance and imported different required libraries of Python.
● Used fine tune parameters like accuracy,f1-score to optimize the model for plant disease detection.
●	Accuracy was calculated for different models and EfficientNetB0 was the most efficient model with the highest accuracy of 98%.
